1 - pattern, uses, next* and simple affects
assign a; variable v; stmt s1, s2, s3;
Select a pattern a(v, _) such that Uses (a, v) and Next* (s1, a) and Affects(s2, s3)
3,4,10,11,12,26,31,38,39,44,45,47,51,53,69,71,72,85,92,95,99,107,113,117,120,127,129,130
5000
2 - same as query 2 but with shifted clauses
assign a; variable v; stmt s1, s2, s3;
Select a pattern a(v, _) such that Affects(s2, s3) and Next* (s1, a) and Uses (a, v)
3,4,10,11,12,26,31,38,39,44,45,47,51,53,69,71,72,85,92,95,99,107,113,117,120,127,129,130
5000
3 - Next* infront of over clauses
assign a, a1; variable v; stmt s; procedure p; 
Select a such that Next* (a, a1) pattern a1(_,_"k"_) such that Follows* (a, s) and Uses (s, "k") 
1,3,4,6,7,8,11,12,25,26,28,29,31,32,33,35,36,43,44,47,49,51,53,78,79,80,81,83,87,89,92,94,95,110,111,112
5000
4 - Same as query 3 but with Next* shifted to back, should not take longer than query 2
assign a, a1; variable v; stmt s; procedure p; 
Select a such that Follows* (a, s) pattern a1(_,_"k"_) such that Next* (a, a1) and Uses (s, "k") 
1,3,4,6,7,8,11,12,25,26,28,29,31,32,33,35,36,43,44,47,49,51,53,78,79,80,81,83,87,89,92,94,95,110,111,112
5000
5 - Next does not terminate
assign a, a1; stmt s; procedure p; 
Select a such that Next* (a, a1) pattern a1(_,_"k"_) such that Follows* (a, s)
1,3,4,6,7,8,11,12,15,25,26,28,29,31,32,33,35,36,39,41,43,44,47,49,51,53,78,79,80,81,83,85,87,89,92,94,95,101,107,110,111,112,117
