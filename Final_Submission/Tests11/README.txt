Welcome, I am SpaXI, the static program analyzer of Team 11. (Turn up your volume, I do talk)

To get me started, 
- execute SpaXI.bat

Before running any of the tests, why not start off by receiving a compliment?
To receive a praise from me, 
- enter [c]

To run all the tests that I owned,
- enter [a]
Sit back and watch the magic unfolds.
All the results will be directed to [TestResult].
Output from cmd will be directed to [TestResult\cmd]
A summary will be generated at the end.
*Python has to be installed for summary to be generated.
*Python can be installed at https://www.python.org/

If you are interested in a specific test, you just need to give me the test number:
[0] Run Sample Test
[1] Run Simple01 Test
[2] Run Simple02 Test
[3] Run Simple03 Test
[4] Run FocusTest\Sequential
[5] Run FocusTest\Loop
[6] Run FocusTest\InterProcedural
[7] Run Validation Test
[8] Run Stress Test
All the results will be directed to [TestResult].
Output from cmd will be directed to [TestResult\cmd]

If you want me to analyse your personal program,
- enter [s]
Don't worry, I will guide you along.

That's all! Thank you! Have a great day ahead!

*Stress tests are used to test my upper limits of processing. Some queries are impossible for me to deliver under 5s.

======================================================================
My shortcomings
======================================================================
Should I fail to run as expected, try the following:
1) Open Visual Studio 2015, build in release mode (The project can be found in Code11)
2) Copy the output AutoTester.exe into this directory
3) Run AutoTester with ths command:
	AutoTester [Source File] [Query File] [Output File]
	
If onstart up and a message occurs, it is probably because I had lost my voice (ate too much snacks), then:
- Run SpaXI_Voiceless.bat instead.
	
I apologise for any inconvenience caused.
