Welcome, I am SpaXI, the static program analyzer of Team 11.

To get me started, 
- execute SpaXI.bat

Before running any of the tests, why not start off by receiving a compliment?
To receive a praise from me, 
- enter [c]

To run all the tests that I owned,
- enter [a]
Sit back and watch the magic unfolds.

If you are interested in a specific test, you just need to give me the test number:
[0] Run Sample Test
[1] Run Simple01 Test
[2] Run Simple02 Test
[3] Run Simple03 Test
[4] Run FocusTest\Sequential
[5] Run FocusTest\Loop
[6] Run FocusTest\InterProcedural
All the results will be directed to [TestResult].
Output from cmd will be directed to [TestResult\cmd]

If you want me to analyse your personal program,
- enter [s]
Don't worry, I will guide you along.

That's all! Thank you! Have a great day ahead!

I apologise for any inconvenience caused.
